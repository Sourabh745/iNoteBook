error: MongoNetworkError: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:27017, connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017


Solution: 

This happened probably because the MongoDB service isn't started. Follow the below steps to start it:

Press the Windows + R keys on your keyboard to open the Run window. Type services.msc and hit Enter on your keyboard or click/tap the OK button. A new window opens up.
Search MongoDB.exe. Right click on it and select Start.
The server will start. Now execute npm start again and the code might work this time.
